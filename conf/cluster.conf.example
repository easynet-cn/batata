# Cluster Configuration File
#
# This file defines the cluster members for Nacos cluster mode.
# Each line should contain one member address in the following format:
#
#   ip:port
#   ip:port?raft_port=xxx
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Port Conventions:
#   - Main HTTP port: 8848 (configurable)
#   - SDK gRPC port: main_port + 1000 (e.g., 9848)
#   - Cluster gRPC port: main_port + 1001 (e.g., 9849)
#   - Raft port: main_port - 1000 (e.g., 7848)
#
# To enable cluster mode:
# 1. Set nacos.standalone=false in application.yml
# 2. Copy this file to conf/cluster.conf
# 3. Add your cluster member addresses below
# 4. Start all nodes with the same configuration
#
# Example 3-node cluster:
#
#192.168.1.10:8848
#192.168.1.11:8848
#192.168.1.12:8848
#
# Example with custom raft port:
#
#192.168.1.10:8848?raft_port=7848
#192.168.1.11:8848?raft_port=7848
#192.168.1.12:8848?raft_port=7848
